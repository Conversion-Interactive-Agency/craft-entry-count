# Entry Count Plugin for Craft CMS 3

The Entry Count Plugin was built specifically for training purposes and is used in the [Craft Plugin Development video course](https://mijingo.com/products/screencasts/craft-plugin-development/).

It allows you to count and display the number of times that an entry has been viewed in  [Craft CMS](https://craftcms.com/). The plugin is intended for educational purposes and can be freely used for simple use-cases. For anything more complex, use the [View Count](https://www.doublesecretagency.com/plugins/view-count) plugin.

## GraphQL Support

GraphQL support has been added in this branch and can be used as follows.

```gql
query EntriesOrderedByCountDesc {
  entries(orderBy: "count desc") {
    id
    count
  }
}
```

The entry count of an entry can be reset using a mutation.

```gql
mutation ResetEntryCount($entryId: ID!) {
  resetEntryCount(entryId: $entryId)
}
```

An entry ID must be provided via query variables.

```gql
{
  "entryId": 147
}
```
